  <h1>QOL</h1>
  <h2>Informational & UI/UX</h2>
  <p class="section-intro">
    The goal of these mods is to prevent you from ever needing to open a wiki. They provide a comprehensive, in-game knowledge base, showing you exactly how to craft items, where to find resources, and what things do, all with a clean and intuitive interface.
  </p>

  <details>
    <summary><a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/emi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EMI (Enough Many Items)</a> & <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tmrv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TooManyRecipeViewers</a></summary>
    <div class="description-content">
      <h4>Layman's Explanation</h4>
      <p>This is the new heart of our in-game "wiki." EMI is a faster, more modern recipe viewer with a better UI and advanced features like a recipe tree to break down complex crafts. TMRV is the magic "universal adapter" that lets all our old JEI-dependent addons (like mob drop viewers) plug directly into EMI without needing JEI itself.</p>
      <h4>Technical Explanation</h4>
      <p>EMI is chosen over JEI for its superior performance and feature set. Its key advantage is asynchronous loadingâ€”it loads recipes after you enter the world, drastically reducing initial load times. TMRV is a high-performance compatibility layer that directly maps JEI API calls to EMI's native functions. This is far more efficient than the alternative (JEMI), which essentially runs a virtual instance of JEI in the background. This combination gives us the performance of EMI with the vast addon compatibility of the JEI ecosystem.</p>
      <h4>The Plugins Below</h4>
      <p>The following mods are addons that "plug in" to this core system, providing even more information.</p>

  <h2>Auditory</h2>
  <p class="section-intro">
    This suite of mods is designed to make the world of "Chen's Better Minecraft" sound alive, immersive, and social. From realistic echoes in caves to in-game proximity chat and long-range radios, these mods remove the need for external programs and add new layers of gameplay through sound.
  </p>

  <details>
    <summary><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simple Voice Chat & Addons</a></summary>
    <div class="description-content">
      <h4>Why We Added It</h4>
      <p>This is the core of our communication system. Simple Voice Chat adds immersive, high-quality proximity voice chat directly into the game, removing the need for external apps like Discord. The following addons build upon this foundation to create an unparalleled auditory experience.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Sound Physics Remastered</summary>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Makes the world sound real. This addon adds realistic reverb and sound muffling, so voices and game sounds will echo in large caves and be dampened through walls. It makes every environment feel distinct and alive.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Vibrative Voice</summary>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Adds a new layer of challenge and interaction. With this addon, your voice now creates vibrations, meaning you can trigger Sculk Sensors and alert the Warden just by speaking. You'll have to think before you talk in the Deep Dark.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Simple Radio</summary>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Provides a diegetic, in-game solution for long-range communication. Instead of global chat, you can craft and use radios to talk to friends across the map, adding a fun layer of progression to team-based play.</p>
      </details>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/presence-footsteps-forge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Presence Footsteps</a></summary>
    <div class="description-content">
      <h4>Why We Added It</h4>
      <p>This is a pure immersion mod that adds a massive variety of high-quality footstep sounds. You'll hear distinct sounds when walking on different types of stone, wood, sand, and more. It's a subtle but powerful change that makes moving through the world feel more tactile and believable.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/music-player" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Music Player</a></summary>
    <div class="description-content">
      <h4>Why We Added It</h4>
      <p>For player convenience and personalization. This mod adds a powerful in-game music player that can play local files or stream directly from sources like YouTube and SoundCloud. It allows you to create your own custom soundtrack for your adventure without ever having to tab out of the game.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extreme-sound-muffler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extreme Sound Muffler</a></summary>
    <div class="description-content">
      <h4>Why We Added It</h4>
      <p>This is a crucial accessibility feature. For players with misophonia, autism, or any other sound sensitivity, certain in-game sounds can be overwhelming. While some mods add blocks to muffle sound, this provides a universal, client-side GUI that gives every player direct control over their own auditory experience without needing to build anything or install resource packs.</p>
      <h4>Layman's Explanation</h4>
      <p>This mod adds a powerful menu (opened with a keybind) that lists all sounds currently playing around you. You can selectively mute or lower the volume of any sound in the game, from a loud machine to an annoying mob. It also allows you to create "Anchors" to only muffle sounds in a specific area, like a noisy farm, without affecting the rest of your world.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/esf-entity-sound-features" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Entity Sound Features (ESF)</a></summary>
    <div class="description-content">
      <h4>Why We Added It</h4>
      <p>This is the audio companion to ETF and EMF. It uses the same resource pack format to allow for custom and varied entity sounds (e.g., different zombie growls or skeleton rattles). This completes the "OptiFine-replacement" suite, adding another layer of dynamic immersion through sound.</p>
