      <h1>The Restoration of Fishing</h1>
      <p class="byline">On turning a passive, boring mechanic into an active, rewarding pursuit.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>The Problem of Passive Fishing</h2>
      <p>Let's be blunt: vanilla fishing is not a game mechanic. It is a timer. You cast a line, you wait for a sound cue, and you click once. There is no skill, no meaningful interaction, and therefore, no real engagement. It’s a slot machine where the only input is your patience, a system that is fundamentally boring.</p>
      <p>With our removal of villager trading and the enchanting table, fishing must be elevated to a primary avenue for acquiring treasure. It cannot remain in this sorry state. It must be transformed from a passive waiting game into an active and skill-based system with a clear progression path. It needs to be a proper game mechanic.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Choosing a Foundation: Aquaculture</h2>
      <p>To give fishing the depth it desperately needs, a new foundation is required. We are using <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/aquaculture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aquaculture 2</a> as the core. This isn't just a handful of new fish; it's a comprehensive expansion that provides the necessary scaffolding for a real system. It adds over 30 new fish tied to specific biomes, giving you a reason to explore the world with a rod in hand. More importantly, it introduces a gear progression system via the Tackle Box, allowing you to customize your rods with different hooks, bait, and bobbers. This creates a loop of fishing to get resources to improve your fishing gear to catch better fish. This is basic, essential design that vanilla lacks.</p>
      <p>To further expand on this, we are also including the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nether-depths-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nether Depths Upgrade</a>. It takes the fishing mechanic and logically extends it to the Nether's lava seas, adding a new layer of risk, a new set of fish to catch, and unique rewards. It seamlessly integrates with the core system, providing more content without needless feature bloat.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Introducing Skill and Engagement</h2>
      <p>However, adding more content doesn't fix the core interaction. It's still a passive waiting game. This is unacceptable. To solve this, we are integrating <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/stardew-fishing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stardew Fishing</a>. This mod, which is explicitly compatible with Aquaculture, completely replaces the vanilla "click when you hear a sound" mechanic with a proper, skill-based minigame. When you hook a fish, you must actively fight to keep it within a target zone to successfully reel it in.</p>
      <p>This is a critical change. Fishing is no longer a passive activity you can AFK. It demands your attention and rewards your skill. Catching a difficult, rare fish feels like an accomplishment because it *is* an accomplishment.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>A New Reward Structure: From Crates to Neptunium</h2>
      <p>With an engaging system in place, the rewards need to be compelling. To enhance the loot pool, we've added <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fishing-crates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fishing Crates</a>, which provide a clear and exciting tiered reward structure. But the ultimate prize from this new system is Neptunium gear, a rare drop that serves as a complete, parallel progression path to Diamond and Netherite armor.</p>
      <p>In a world with the vanilla enchanting system, this gear would quickly become overpowered. But in our world—a world without enchantments—its value is fundamentally different. Every piece of Neptunium gear, every rare fish, every bounty, and every crate feels substantially more rewarding because its power isn't immediately eclipsed by a generic "god" set. To succeed, you are now encouraged to assemble a dedicated fishing loadout: your trusty Angler's Hat artifact, your best rod, and the right bait for the job.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Sustainable Loop of Neptunium</h2>
      <p>The true beauty of Neptunium armor is how its unique abilities gain value in the absence of enchantments. Obtaining permanent water breathing is no longer a trivial matter. Your only other options are temporary potions, a limited-range conduit, or the minor boosts from a Snorkel or Turtle Shell. In this context, the free-diving mobility granted by a full set of Neptunium armor feels powerful and, more importantly, *earned*.</p>
      <p>But this power comes with a responsibility. There is no Mending to save you. There is no Unbreaking. When your Neptunium gear takes damage, it must be repaired with more Neptunium. This creates a sustainable, engaging endgame loop. Fishing is no longer a one-time activity to get a specific item; it is a permanent profession you must return to in order to maintain your powerful, specialized aquatic gear. This is how you create lasting, meaningful content. Not with a one-time grind, but with a self-sustaining system of risk, reward, and maintenance.</p>
